Explain in your own words and examples, what is Shell Scripting for DevOps.

Shell Scripting is an open-source operating system.

shell scripts consist of a set of commands to perform a task.

All the commands execute sequentially

we can use shell scripting for automation

Example :- #!/bin/bash

echo "Hello Safia"

What is #!/bin/bash? can we write #!/bin/sh as well?

This is known as shebang in Unix.

In the scripting language, we denote interpreter as #!/bin/sh It was one most widely supported by other shells like bash (free/open), kash (not free).

Bash (Bourne again shell) is a shell replacement for the Bourne shell. Bash is a superset of sh.#!/bin/bash

yes we can use #!/bin/sh instead of #!/bin/bash

Write a Shell Script which prints I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge

#!/bin/bash

echo " I will complete#90DaysOofDevOps challenge "

Write a Shell Script to take user input, input from arguments and print the variables.

Write an Example of If else in Shell Scripting by comparing 2 numbers

#!/bin/bash

a=30

b=7

if [ $a -ge $b ]

then

echo "The variable 'a' is greater than the variable 'b'."

else

echo "The variable 'b' is greater than the variable 'a'."
