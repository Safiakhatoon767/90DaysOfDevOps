File Permission And Access Control List (ACL)
Types of permissions

r - read 4

w - write 2

x - execute 1

Permission (rwx) levels

u - yourself (the current user)

g - group to which the user belong to

o - others (outside the group)

a - all

How to see the permissions?

ls -ltr

find group information

id <user_name>

How to change the permission?

chmod u+r <file_name> (for adding permission)

chmod u-r <file_name> (for removing permission)

chmod ugo+r <file_name>

chmod ugo-r <file_name>

chmod a+rwx <file_name> (adding the permission for all)

chmod a-rwx <file_name> (for removing all the permission)

chmod g+rw <file_name> (for adding permission to group)

Note: one more important thing is you can't change other user permission it means when u logged in to Safia user but change the permission of the root user then you can't but the root user can change all permission of other users but normal users can't.

chmod Numeric Mode

Ex : chmod 756 <file_name>

so here,

The first numeric number 7 shows the user

The second numeric number 5 shows the group

The Third numeric number 6 shows the other user

Access Control List (ACL)

What is ACL?

It allows you to give a more specific set of permissions to a file or directory without changing the base ownership and permission.

Commands : setfacl & getfacl

getfacl:- The getfacl command displays the access permissions of files and directories with file name, owner, group and the ACLs (Access Control List).

getfacl<file_name>

setfacl

For adding permission for the user

setfacl -m u:user_name:rwx <target_file>

For adding the permission for group

setfacl -m:g:group_name:rwx <target_file>

To remove a specific entry

setfacl -x u:user_name:rwx <target_file>

To remove all entries

setfacl -b <target_file>

where,

-m - modification

-x - remove permission

-b - remove all entries

For adding permissions for the user in all the files inside a folder - (it means only one user to permit to access the file/folder)

setfacl -Rm "entry" <targetfile/folder>

ex : setfacl -Rm u:safia:rwx my_folder

File Ownership Commands

chown: To change user ownership.

chgrp: To change group ownership.

sudo chown -c Safia test_file

sudo chgrp -c Dev_Safia test_file
