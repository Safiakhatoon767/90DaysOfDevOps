Read about different Data Types in Python.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Integers: Represent whole numbers, e.g. 0,1, 2, 300, -1, -2.

Floats: Represent decimal numbers, e.g. 1.545, 2.5, 3.14.

Strings: Represent sequences of characters, e.g. "hello world".

Booleans: Represent true or false values, e.g. True, False.

Lists: A collection of items in a particular order.

Tuples: A collection of items in a particular order, but unlike lists, tuples are immutable.

Dictionaries: A collection of key-value pairs.

Sets: A collection of unique items.
